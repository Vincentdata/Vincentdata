👋 Hi, I’m @Vincentdata

👀 I’m interested in marine ecosystems and how data science can be used to protect and study oceanic environments. :fish:

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on marine conservation, sustainable management of ocean resources, or innovative uses of data to monitor and protect marine life. If you're working on applications of AI in environmental science, I’d love to connect and contribute.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration
